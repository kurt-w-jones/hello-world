# hello-world
First repo as a new user to GitHub
I've been in the technology field for twenty years but have never learned how to code.  I'm starting my journey by learning Git, then HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn how to build a simple website.  I will then travel along to learn how to host that website in AWS.  From there I would like to establish a continous development/continuous integration setup to better understand how all of this works together as an ecosystem.
